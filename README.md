# Outside the Traffic Box

>This polygon represents the traffic box for the
[2015 World Meeting of Families](http://www.worldmeeting2015.org/).

>Traffic will not be permitted to enter this area when
the traffic box takes effect on September 25, 2015."

To demonstrate how the Papal visit will affect
the residents of Philly and to provide visitors
with some context about the city, I juxtaposed
the map of the ["traffic box"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/world-meeting-of-families-traffic-box) (in Vatican colors)
with a map of [Philly's schools](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/schools). Explore!

My original intention was to show how issues the
Pope will discuss in Philadelphia, like immigration
and poverty, manifest themselves in the city.
